# IoT-Based-Smart-Classroom

The project aims to develop an IoT-based smart classroom system to save electricity and improve attendance management in educational institutes. 
The system uses NodeMCU and Raspberry Pi boards to control electrical components in the classroom and mark attendance using biometric sensors. The system also includes a cross-platform mobile application developed using Flutter SDK. The system solves the problems of electricity wastage and inefficiency in traditional attendance management systems.
